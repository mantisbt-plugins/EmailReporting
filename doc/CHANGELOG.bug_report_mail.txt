	- mail_mantisbt_url is now called mail_mantisbt_url_fix because variables with url in the end are not allowed to be stored in the database anymore

Dec 2009 v3 - EmailReporting-0.7.3
	- Applied a natural case insensitive sort on the charset dropdown list in the configuration menu
	- Changed the sort method from normal sort to natural case insensitive sort for mailbox_auth_method
	- Mimedecode pear package updated to new version
	- rfc_822bodies (new option in mimedecode) forced to false
	- The messages in IMAPs with the deleted status will not be counted towards the mail_fetch_max counter

	- Adjusted the check whether bug_report_mail can run in a webserver to the same method as in send_emails.php
	- The On and Off texts have been replaced by Yes and No
	- Added helper_mantis_url around 1st bug_report_mail link on the configuration page

Dec 2009 v2 - EmailReporting-0.7.2
	- If a charset has already been found in the email it will stop searching for other charsets
	- If a attachment has a size of 0 bytes it will now be added to the rejected-files.txt else it will block proper processing of emails
	- The max attachment size will now be calculated the same way Mantis does
	- Added SSL support for IMAP and POP3 connections partially based on work from obstbaum80
	- mailbox_auth_method will save the selected value properly now (obstbaum80)
	- The possible values for mailbox_auth_method are now retrieved from the pear packages Net_IMAP and Net_POP3
	- various small code optimizations

Dec 2009 - EmailReporting-0.7.0
	- Added a fix for the adding of bugnotes when the issue is readonly (~21199)
	- Sometimes the charset names in emails were lowercase while mb_list_encodings returned names using a mix of upper and lower case names. This caused problems for detecting valid encodings used in emails
	- Support for IMAP has been added based on Rolf Kleef's work
	- Added Net_IMAP 1.0.3 to this package. 1.1.0 seems to be broken in some situations so EmailReporting will force the use of 1.0.3
	- Added sanity check to the bug priority array config. If this fails the old value will be retained
	- mail_auth_method (now called mailbox_auth_method) has been moved from the configuration menu to the mailbox settings. This way you can modify this per mailbox
	- Script is now declared compatible with 1.2.0rc2
	- Restored lost functionality to mail_fetch_max. This functionality was lost from version mantis-1.0.3.patch.gz and onwards. You might want to increase the mail_fetch_max value since by default it wil only retrieve one email per mailbox everytime bug_report_mail.php is executed
	- Deleting mailboxes works again. Seems to have been broken since the 0.5.0 release

Okt 2009 - EmailReporting-0.6.3
	- mb_convert_encoding converted strings even if they were using the same charsets. This caused the necessary problems since somehow certain chars seemed to be replaced with empty spaces.
	- EmailReporting will now try to retrieve the charset from the email content type if it is present, as this works better then the auto detect of mbstring functions for conversion. As a fallback it will still try the auto detect if the charset is missing.

Sep 2009 - EmailReporting-0.6.2
	- Incase the email address is not encapsulated with the proper chars EmailReporting will consider the whole string the email address (Note ~22839)
	- Problems with locating pear.php have been corrected and pear5.php is now also present in the package
	- Added a limit on the maximum allowed file size so that the emails containing those attachments don't block further processing (uses the max_file_size setting of mantis)

Aug 2009 v2 - EmailReporting-0.6.1
	- bug_report_mail.sql has been removed to avoid confusions about needing to use it
	- Decrypting the mailbox password did not occur before editing. Fixed (Note ~22655)
	- A new variable is added which resets the plugin schema and fixes the Mail Reporter user when it has the email address "nomail" (Automatically done during the first initialization of the plugin)
	- Removed functions which performed the exclusion of emails to Mail Reporter with "nomail" mail address

Aug 2009 - EmailReporting-0.6
	- The script now also recognizes a possible name in the from part of emails. It uses this as the username during the creation of the user
	- Cleaned up some more useless files that were not used
	- User creation during the installation of the plugin is now handled by mantis api's, schema functions no longer needed.

Jul 2009 - EmailReporting-0.5
	- Modified script to the new plugin architecture of mantis 1.2.0rc1
	- This script no longer needs new fields created in the database. This allows installation on mantis configurations where the database user only has select, insert, update and delete rights
	- custom_file_api.php has been updated to reflect the changes in its original Mantis counterpart
	- Cleaned up functions and files that were no longer usefull and / or necessary
	- Script did not use the default severity and default reproducibility for new bugs, it does now
	- New setting called secured_script to protect it from running on a webserver. Uses the same method as the send_emails.php job
	- File types that are not allowed will now be properly skipped during processing of attachments in emails so that it doesn't cause further errors down the line
	- mail_additional config setting is now called mail_add_complete_email and saves the complete email as an attachment .txt document instead of in the "Additional information" field
	- replaced html2text 1.2 (phphtmlparser) with simplehtmldom 1.11 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/
	- Names of attachments will now also be processed by mbstring to convert the character encoding. The content of the attachment does not need to be processed since its stored as binary
	- Parser will try the content-disposition field and the content-type field for a name if the name seems to be missing. As a fallback a alternative name will be provided incase of attachments of type email
	- Added support to use a different port for the pop3 server.
	- A lot of rewrites for the processing in parser.php and mail_api.php. It should now process all attachments properly
	- Reversible encryption will now be applied to the mailbox password
	- Updated the user information inside bug_report_mail.sql. This file is useless now though since the adding of the user is handled by the plugin
	- php.ini var upload-tmp-dir no longer used, the script will use the config mail_tmp_directory for temporarily saving attachments
	- html parsing no longer requires the file to be physically saved. mail_tmp_directory no longer needed here
	- The Mail Reporter user will now be filtered out of the email system as long as he has "nomail" as a email address
	- Identifying bugnotes works again
	- New function which removes automatic mantis emails from bugnotes

	- print_r changed to var_dump's (Works better if you have xdebug extension installed)
	- New config setting called:
		# Default bug category for mail reported bugs (Defaults to "default_bug_category")
		# Because in Mantis 1.1.0a3 a category is required, we need a default category for issues reported by email.
		# Make sure the category exists and it has been configured correctly
		$g_mail_default_bug_category = '%default_bug_category%';
	- Fixed a missing variable in the function: "mail_process_all_mails"
		$t_mail_debug was not set and would cause notice level errors and debug mode in this function wouldn't work ( ~13854 )
